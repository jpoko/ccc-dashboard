## Interpersonal reactivity: Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI)   


### Overview of the scale

**Description:** Two aspects of interpersonal reactivity were measured, empathic 
concern and personal distress, using two subscales (Empathic Concern and Personal 
Distress) from the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI; Davis 1980, 1983). The 
28-item IRI was designed to measure four subscales of dispositional empathy: 
Perspective Taking, Fantasy, Empathic Concern, and Personal Distress. Here, we 
measured two subscales with a total of 14-items (7 items for each subscale).   




**Example items:** *"I often have tender, concerned feelings for people less fortunate than me"*
(empathic concern), and 
*"I sometimes feel helpless when I am in the middle of a very emotional situation"*
(personal distress).  

**Response scale:** Participants were asked to rate these items on a 5-point 
Likert scale (0–4: 0 = Strongly disagree, 1 = Slightly disagree, 2 = Neutral/Mixed, 
3 = Slightly agree, 4 = Strongly agree).  



**Scoring:** The table below shows the item numbers used in the CCC study along 
with the item numbers from the original, 28-item IRI scale. From our 14-item 
version, items 2, 6, 7, 9, and 10 are reverse scored (which correspond to items 
4, 13, 14, 18, and 19 on the original 28-item scale). The empathic concern 
subscale is calculated by summing items 1, 2, 4, 7, 9, 11, 12. Personal distress 
is calculated by summing items 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 13, 14. 


| CCC item | Original item | Subscale           | Reverse scored |
|----------|---------------|--------------------|----------------|
| 1        | 2             | Empathic concern   |                |
| 2        | 4             | Empathic concern   | Yes            |
| 3        | 5             | Personal distress  |                |
| 4        | 9             | Empathic concern   |                |
| 5        | 10            | Personal distress  |                |
| 6        | 13            | Personal distress  | Yes            |
| 7        | 14            | Empathic concern   | Yes            |
| 8        | 17            | Personal distress  |                |
| 9        | 18            | Empathic concern   | Yes            |
| 10       | 19            | Personal distress  | Yes            |
| 11       | 20            | Empathic concern   |                |
| 12       | 22            | Empathic concern   |                |
| 13       | 24            | Personal distress  |                |
| 14       | 27            | Personal distress  |                |




**Interpretation:** Possible scores for each subscale range from 0–28. Higher 
scores indicate higher levels of empathic concern or personal distress.   




**Time points:** The Interpersonal Reactivity Index subscales were administered 
at all four assessment points (T1, T2, T3, T4).   

**Differences between the CCC implementation and the original scale:**

The Interpersonal Reactivity Index was given in its original form with the 
following exceptions:  
The CCC version only used two of the four subscales. Empathic concern (EC) and 
Personal distress (PD).  

<u>Response Option Change(s)</u>: The original scale: 0 = does not describe me
well, 4 = described me very well; The CCC adapted version 0 = strongly disagree, 
1 = slightly disagree, 2 = neutral/mixed, 3 = slightly agree, 4 = strongly agree.  

<u>Changes to items</u>: An additional open ended question was added at the 
end of the scale at all 4 timepoints to allow participants to share any 
additional thoughts (“Is there anything else you would like to share about 
how you tend to respond during emotionally challenging situations?). Responding 
to this question was optional.   

**Additional Information:**
An attention check item (att.3) was included in this scale between items 12 and 13.
