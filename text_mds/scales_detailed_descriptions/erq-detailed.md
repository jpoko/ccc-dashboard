## Reappraisal: Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ)    

### Overview of the scale   

**Description:** This 11-item Reappraisal Capability questionnaire is an adaptation 
of the 10-item Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (Gross & John, 2003) to measure 
respondents’ tendency to regulate their emotions through cognitive reappraisal. 
The original ERQ measures both Cognitive Reappraisal and Expressive Suppression. 
Here we measured cognitive reappraisal with 6 items from the ERQ along with 5 
additional items.  


**Example items:** *“When I really want to, I am very capable of controlling my emotions by changing the way I think about the situation I’m in”*, and 
*“When I really want to, I am very capable of changing the way I am thinking about a situation that is likely to make me feel strong emotions.”*   

**Response scale:** Participants were asked to indicate their level of agreement 
with each item using a 7-point Likert-type scale (1–7: 1 = strongly disagree, 
2 = moderately disagree, 3 = slightly disagree, 4 = neutral/mixed, 5 = slightly 
agree, 6 = moderately agree, 7 = strongly agree).    


**Scoring:** Items are summed. No items are reverse scored.  

-   Cognitive Reappraisal, original items 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10   
-   Cognitive Reappraisal, additional items 4, 7, 8, 9, 11   



**Interpretation:** Possible scores range from 11–77.  Higher scores indicate 
higher cognitive reappraisal.    



**Time points:** The Reappraisal Capability Questionnaire was administered as 
part of the Secondary Questionnaire at the baseline and 1-year assessments (T1, T4).  

**Differences between the CCC implementation and the original scale:**  

<u>Changes to items:</u> Order of sentences have been rearranged in the CCC 
adapted version along with some slight wording changes - the ordering of the 
parts of sentences has been switched, for instance, item 1 original: When I want 
to feel more *positive* emotion (such as joy or amusement), I *change what I am thinking about.*
Item 1 CCC study: I am very capable of changing <u>**what I’m thinking about**</u> 
when I want to feel more positive emotion (such as joy or amusement).   


Note that in the example above (item 1), the italic in the original and bold with 
underline in the CCC study is the specific formatting of the original and CCC study, 
respectively.  


An additional open ended question was added to the end of the scale at both time 
points that it was given to allow participants to share additional thoughts 
(“Is there anything else you have noticed about your ability to change the way 
that you think about situations, including any changes that you may have noticed 
during the pandemic?”). Responding to this question was optional.  

<u>Changes to response scale:</u> CCC adapted scale used the 6 reappraisal items 
from the original ERQ (items 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10; did not include the 4 suppression 
items [2, 4, 6, 9]) and then created 5 new items to assess reappraisal. 
Items that are not in the original scale are 4, 7, 8, 9, and 11.
