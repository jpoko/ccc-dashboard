## Interpersonal regulation: Interpersonal Regulation Questionnaire (IRQ)    

### Overview of the scale    

**Description:** The 16-item Interpersonal Regulation Questionnaire is used to measure engagement in interpersonal emotion regulation (i.e., using social interaction to regulate one’s own emotions). The scale consists of 4 subscales 1) Negative-Tendency (IRQ-NT), or the *tendency to pursue* interpersonal emotion regulation to *decrease negative emotions*, 2) Negative-Efficacy (IRQ-NE), or the *perceived efficacy* of *reducing negative emotions* through interpersonal emotional regulation, 3) Positive-Tendency  (IRQ-PT), or the *tendency to pursue* interpersonal emotion regulation to *increase positive emotions*, and 4) Positive-Efficacy (IRQ-PE), or the *perceived efficacy* of *enhancing positive emotions* through interpersonal emotional regulation, (Williams, Morelli, & Zaki, 2018).   




**Example items:** *"I manage my emotions by expressing them to others,"* and
*"I find that even just being around other people can help me to feel better."*

**Response scale:** Participants were asked to indicate their level of 
agreement with each item using a 7-point Likert-type scale (1--7: 1 = strongly 
disagree, 2 = moderately disagree, 3 = slightly disagree, 4 = neutral/mixed, 
5 = slightly agree, 6 = moderately agree, 7 = strongly agree). 


**Scoring:** No items are reverse scored. Items are summed to calculate a total 
interpersonal regulation score. Subscale scores are calculated by summing the 
items as follows:  

- 	Negative-Tendency (IRQ-NT), items 3, 6, 7, 10 (original items 1, 2, 3, 4)  
-	Negative-Efficacy (IRQ-NE), items 1, 5, 13, 17 (original items 5, 6, 7, 8)  
-	Positive-Tendency (IRQ-PT), items 9, 11, 15, 16 (original items 9, 10, 11, 12)  
-	Positive-Efficacy (IRQ-PE), items 2, 4, 8, 12 (original items 13, 14, 15, 16)   




**Interpretation:** Possible total scores can range from 16--112. Possible scores for each of the four subscales range from 4–28. Higher scores indicate higher levels of interpersonal emotion regulation.  

**Time points:** The Interpersonal Regulation Questionnaire (IRQ) was 
administered as part of the Secondary Questionnaire at the baseline and at the 
1-year follow-up assessment. (T1, T4)      

**Differences between the CCC implementation and the original scale:**   
The Interpersonal Regulation Questionnaire was given in its original form with 
the following exceptions:   

<u>Response option change(s):</u>     

Original scale: (1) strongly disagree (2) disagree (3) somewhat disagree (4) neither agree nor disagree (5) somewhat agree (6) agree (7) strongly agree.  

CCC scale: (1) Strongly disagree (2) Moderately disagree (3) Slightly disagree (4) Neutral/Mixed (5) Slightly agree (6) Moderately agree (7) Strongly agree.  

<u>Item order change:</u>     
Items were reordered randomly.
