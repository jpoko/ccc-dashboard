## Rumination & reflection: Rumination-Reflection Questionnaire (RRQ)  



### Overview of the scale

**Description:** The 24-item Rumination-Reflection Questionnaire (Trapnell & 
Campbell, 1999) is designed to measure self-attentiveness/self-consciousness 
along the two dimensions of rumination and reflection.   




**Example items:** *"I often find myself re-evaluating something I’ve done"*
(rumination), and 
*"My attitudes and feelings about things fascinate me"* 
(reflection).  

**Response scale:** Participants were asked to indicate their level of 
agreement with each item using a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 to 5 
( 1 = Strongly Disagree; 2 = Slightly Disagree; 3 = Neutral/Mixed; 4 = Slightly 
Agree; 5 = Strongly Agree).  






**Scoring:** Items 6, 9, 10, 13, 14, 17, 20, and 24 are reverse scored. 
Subscales are then are calculated by averaging the following items: 

-   Rumination, items 1–12 
-   Reflection, items 13–24 (were labeled 1-12 when given at baseline)  



**Interpretation:** Possible scores for each subscale range from 1–5. 
Higher scores indicate higher levels of rumination or reflection.  








**Time points:** The reflection subscale was administered as part of the 
baseline assessment (T1), and both subscales were given during the 1-year 
assessment (T4).  

**Differences between the CCC implementation and the original scale:**

<u>Wording change to response options</u>: The original Likert scale had labels 
of (1) strongly disagree (2) disagree (3) neutral (4) agree (5) strongly agree. 
In the CCC adapted version, response options were: (1) Strongly Disagree (2) 
Slightly disagree (3) Neutral/Mixed (4) Slightly agree (5) Strongly agree.  

<u>Items</u>: The items 1-12 given on the CCC version correspond to items 
13-24 on the original questionnaire.
