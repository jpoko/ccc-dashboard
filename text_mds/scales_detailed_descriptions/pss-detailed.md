## Perceived stress: Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)  

### Overview of the scale   

**Description:** The 10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) is used to
measure how stressful respondents judge situations in their life to be
(Cohen et al., 1983). Items are designed to assess how unpredictable,
uncontrollable, and overwhelming individuals find their lives (Cohen & 
Williamson 1988). The 10-item scale (Cohen & Williamson 1988) was derived from the
original 14-item scale (Cohen et al., 1983) and includes items 1--3, 6--11, and
14 from the original scale. A version of the 10-item scale can be found

**Example items:** *"In the last month, how often have you been upset because of something that happened unexpectedly?"* 
and *"In the last month, how often have you been able to control irritations in your life?"*

**Response scale:** Participants were asked to indicate the frequency
with which they experienced each item <u>during the last month</u> using
a 5-point scale (0--4: 0 = never; 1 = almost never; 2 = sometimes; 3 =
fairly often; 4 = very often).  


**Scoring:** Items 4, 5, 7, and 8 are reverse scored. Items are then
summed to calculate a total perceived stress score. There are no
subscales.  

**Interpretation:** Possible scores range from 0--40, with higher scores
indicating higher stress.  

-   Scores ranging from 0--13 indicate low perceived stress.  
-   Scores ranging from 14--26 indicate moderate perceived stress.  
-   Scores ranging from 27--40 indicate high perceived stress.    


**Time points:** The PSS was administered as part of the Primary
Questionnaires at all 4 time points (T1, T2, T3, T4).  

**Differences between the CCC implementation and the original scale:**
The 10-item scale was given in its original form, with one exception: To
make reading easier on participants, the instructions were modified
slightly so that the wording was more consistent with that of other
instructions in the study. The meaning was preserved.  

*Original Instructions:* "The questions in this scale ask you about your
feelings and thoughts during the last month. In each case, you will be
asked to indicate by circling how often you felt or thought a certain
way."  

*CCC Instructions:* "These questions ask about your feelings and
thoughts during the last month. For each item, please indicate how often
you felt or thought a certain way."
