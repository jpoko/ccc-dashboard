## Racism: Racism and Life Experiences Scale (RaLES)  


### Overview of the scale

**Description:** The 20-item the Racism and Life Experiences Scale (RaLES) is 
used to measure multiple aspects of racism-related stress.   



**Example items:** *"Race related conflict between you and someone of a different race/ethnicity,"*
and 
*"Others expecting you to be, or treating you like, stereotypes of your racial/ethnic group."*   

**Response scale:** Participants rated how often they experienced each situation 
on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 to 4 (0 = never, 1 = a few times, 2 = monthly, 
3 = weekly, 4 = daily). For each experience, they also rated how much stress it 
had caused them on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 to 4 (0 = no stress, 1 = a 
little, 2 = somewhat, 3 = very, 4 = extremely).  





**Scoring:** Two subscales are calculated from the items, a frequency score and
a stress score. To calculate, take the average of the responses to each of the
respective questions. Scores will range from 0 to 4.  






**Interpretation:** Higher scores indicate more frequent racist experiences and 
more stress from the experiences.  







**Time points:** The Racism and Life Experiences Scale was administered at the 
baseline and 1-year assessments (T1, T4).
