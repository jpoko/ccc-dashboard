## Personality: Big Five Inventory (BFI)   




### Overview of the scale

**Description:** This 30-item form of the Big Five Inventory (Soto & John, 2017) 
is used to measure the Big Five personality dimensions of extraversion, openness, 
agreeableness, negative emotionality, and conscientiousness.  


**Example items:** *"I see myself as someone who is depressed, blue"*
(negative emotionality), and 
*"I see myself as someone who is original, comes up with new ideas"*
(openness).    

**Response scale:** Participants were asked to indicate their level of 
agreement with each item using a 7-point Likert-type scale (1–7: 1 = strongly 
disagree, 2 = moderately disagree, 3 = slightly disagree, 4 = neutral/mixed, 
5 = slightly agree, 6 = moderately agree, 7 = strongly agree).  





**Scoring:** Subscales with item numbers (item numbers refer to our item numbers). 
R indicates items that are reverse scored.  

-   Extraversion (E): 1R, 6, 8, 13R, 18, 26R  
-   Agreeableness (A): 2, 7R, 9R, 14, 19, 27R  
-   Conscientiousness (C): 3R, 10, 15R, 20, 23, 28R  
-   Negative Emotionality (N): 4, 11R, 16, 21R, 24R, 29  
-   Openness (O): 5, 12R, 17R, 22, 25, 30R  


Note that the item numbering here does not match the item numbering of the 
original scale. 






**Interpretation:** Possible scores for the five subscale range from 6–42. 
Higher scores on any scale indicate higher levels of extraversion, openness, 
agreeableness, negative emotionality, and conscientiousness.  






**Time points:** The Big Five Inventory was administered at the baseline and 
1-year assessments (T1, T4).    

**Differences between the CCC implementation and the original scale:**

<u>Likert scale change</u>: In the original version of the questionnaire, 
a 5-point Likert scale was used ranging from strongly disagree, disagree a little, 
neutral/no opinion, agree a little, to agree strongly. The CCC adapted version 
used a 7-point Likert scale ranging from strongly disagree, moderately disagree, 
slightly disagree, neutral/no opinion, slightly agree, moderately agree, to 
strongly agree.  

<u>Item numbering change</u>: CCC adapted version items 1-30 correspond to the 
original items in this order: 1-7, 16-22, 8-15, 23-30.
