## Distress tolerance: Distress Tolerance Scale-Short Form (DTS-SF)  

### Overview of the scale    

**Description:** The 4-item Distress Tolerance Scale-Short Form (Garner et al., 2018) was adapted from the original 15-item Distress Tolerance Scale (Simons & Gaher, 2005) and measures an individual’s ability to tolerate negative emotional states.  

**Example items:** *"My feelings of distress are so intense that they completely take over,"*
and *"I’ll do anything to stop feeling distressed or upset."*  

**Response scale:** Participants were asked to rate these items on a 5-point 
Likert scale (1–5: 1 = Strongly agree, 2 = Slightly agree, 3 = Neutral/Mixed, 
4 = Slightly disagree, 5 = Strongly disagree).  


**Scoring:** No items are reverse scored. The 4 items are summed for a total 
distress tolerance score. There are no subscales.    

**Interpretation:** Possible Distress Tolerance Scale-Short form total scores range from 4--20. Higher scores indicate higher distress tolerance ability.    

**Time points:** The Distress Tolerance Scale-Short Form was given as part of 
the Secondary Questionnaire at the baseline and 1-year assessments. (T1, T4).     

**Differences between the CCC implementation and the original scale:**  
The Distress Tolerance-Short Form was given in its original form.
