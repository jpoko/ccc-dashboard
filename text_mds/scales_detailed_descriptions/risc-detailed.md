## Resilience: The Conner-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC)  

### Overview of the scale   

**Description:** The 10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) is 
designed to measure resilience (Campbell-Sills & Stein, 2007) using a selection 
of items from the original 25-item version of the scale developed by Conner 
and Davidson (2003).  

**Example items:** *“I am able to adapt when changes occur”* and 
*“I tend to bounce back after illness, injury, or other hardships”*. 

**Response scale:** Participants were asked to indicate the likelihood of each 
item <u>over the past month</u> using a 5-point Likert scale (0--4: 0 = not true at 
all, 1 = rarely true, 3 = sometimes true, 4 = true nearly all the time).  

**Scoring:** No items to reverse score. Items are summed to calculate a total 
resilience score. There are no subscales.  

**Interpretation:** Possible scores range from 0--40, with higher scores 
reflecting greater resilience. For comparison, mean scores for general 
population samples can be found

**Time points:** The CD-RISC was administered as part of the Primary 
Questionnaires at all 4 time points (T1, T2, T3, T4).     

**Differences between the CCC implementation and the original scale:** The 
CD-RISC-10 was administered in its original form.  

**Additional information:**  
NOTE: There are 3 versions of the scale authorized for use: CD-RISC-25, 
CD-RISC-10, and CD-RISC-2. The number indicates the number of items on the 
scale. The original 25-item scale (score range 0--100) was reported in 
Conner & Davidson (2003). Note, this publication includes only a brief 
description of the items and the scoring—not enough information to recreate 
the instrument. The 10-item scale (score range 0--40) was created by 
Campbell-Sills & Stein (2007), and includes items 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 11, 14, 16, 
17, 19 from the original scale. The 2-item scale (score range 0--8) was created 
by Vaishnavi et al. (2007), based on items 1 and 8 of the original. Permission 
must be obtained by the authors to use the scale (any version). See
