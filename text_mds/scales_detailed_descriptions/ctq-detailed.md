## Childhood trauma: Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-Short Form (CTQ)    

### Overview of the scale   

**Description:** The 28-item Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-Short Form 
(Bernstein et al., 2003) is used to assess childhood maltreatment histories. 
The scale measures emotional abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional 
neglect, and physical neglect.   



**Example items:** *“My parents were too drunk or high to take care of the family”* 
(physical neglect), 
*"People in my family said hurtful or insulting things to me"* (emotional abuse),
and 
*“Someone tried to make me do sexual things or watch sexual things”* (sexual abuse).          


**Response scale:** Participants were asked to indicate how true they feel each 
item is using a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (never true) to 5 
(very often true).   



**Scoring:** Items 2, 5, 7, 13, 19, 26, and 28 are reverse coded. Items are 
summed to calculate an overall total score, as well as individual subscale scores, 
with the exception of the validity scale.   

-   Emotional abuse, items: 3, 8, 14, 18, 25  
-   Physical abuse, items: 9, 11, 12, 15, 17  
-   Sexual abuse, items: 20, 21, 23, 24, 27  
-   Emotional neglect, items: 5, 7, 13, 19, 28  
-   Physical neglect, items: 1, 2, 4, 6, 26  

For the Validity subscale, one point is given for each item that was given the 
response of 5 = Very often true.   

-   Validity, items: 10, 16, 22   



**Interpretation:** Possible total scores range from 25–125. Possible subscale 
scores range from 5–25. Scores fall into four categories: none-low trauma exposure, 
low-moderate trauma exposure, moderate-severe trauma exposure and 
severe-extreme trauma exposure. Higher scores/percentiles in each domain represent 
higher levels of maltreatment ranging from none to severe. The validity scale 
has a possible range of 0 to 3.   



**Time points:** The Childhood Trauma Questionnaire was administered at the 
baseline assessment (T1).
