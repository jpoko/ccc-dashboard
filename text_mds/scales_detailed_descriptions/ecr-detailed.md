## Attachment: Experience in Close Relationships - 12 (ECR-12)

### Overview of the scale

**Description:** The 12-item Experiences in Close Relationships-12
(ECR-12) questionnaire (Lafontaine et al., 2016) is based on the 36-item
Experiences in Close Relationships questionnaire, which is designed to
measure adult romantic attachment (Brennan, Clark, & Shaver, 1998). The
ECR-12 consists of 12 items comprising two subscales: attachment anxiety
(6 items) and attachment avoidance (6 items).

**Example items:** *"I worry about being rejected or abandoned"*
(anxiety), and 
*"I usually discuss my problems and concerns with my partner"* (avoidance).

**Response scale:** Participants were asked to indicate their level of
agreement with each item using a 7-point Likert-type scale (1--7: 1 =
strongly disagree, 2 = moderately disagree, 3 = slightly disagree, 4 =
neutral/mixed, 5 = slightly agree, 6 = moderately agree, 7 = strongly
agree).

**Scoring:** The table below shows item numbers for the 12-item scale
used in this study, along with the item numbers from the original
36-item questionnaire. Items 6, 9, 10, 11, and 12 are reverse scored
(which correspond to items 15, 25, 27, 29, and 31 on the original
36-item scale). Items 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 8 are averaged to calculate the
anxiety score, and items 4, 6, 9, 10, 11, and 12 are averaged to
calculate the avoidance score.

| CCC item | Original item | Subscale | Reverse scored |
|:----------:|:---------------:|:----------:|:----------------:|
| 1        | 2             | Anxious  |                |
| 2        | 6             | Anxious  |                |
| 3        | 8             | Anxious  |                |
| 4        | 9             | Avoidant |                |
| 5        | 14            | Anxious  |                |
| 6        | 15            | Avoidant | Yes            |
| 7        | 18            | Anxious  |                |
| 8        | 24            | Anxious  |                |
| 9        | 25            | Avoidant | Yes            |
| 10       | 27            | Avoidant | Yes            |
| 11       | 29            | Avoidant | Yes            |
| 12       | 31            | Avoidant | Yes            |

**Interpretation:** Possible scores for the two subscales range from
1--7. Higher scores indicate higher attachment insecurity.

**Time points:** The ECR-12 was administered at the baseline and 1-year
assessments (T1, T4).
