## Lonliness: UCLA Loneliness Scale (ULS)  

### Overview of the scale   

**Description:** The 3-item Loneliness Scale is designed to measure subjective 
feelings of loneliness (Hughes, Waite, Hawkley, & Cacioppo, 2004). It is an 
adaptation of the longer 20-item UCLA Loneliness Scale (Russell, Peplau, & 
Ferguson, 1978; Russell, Peplau, & Cutrona, 1980; Russel, 1996).  

**Example items:** *“How often do you feel that you lack companionship?”*, 
*“How often do you feel left out?”* and 
*“How often do you feel isolated from others?”*   

**Response scale:** Participants were asked to indicate how frequently they 
feel a particular way <u>over the past month</u> using 3-point scale 
(1--3; 1= hardly ever; 2 = some of the time; 3 = often).  


**Scoring:** No items are reverse scored. Items are summed to calculate a total 
loneliness score. Some researchers have grouped people who score between 3 and 
5 as “not lonely” and those with scores between 6 and 9 as “lonely’ [citation
TBA].   

**Interpretation:** Possible scores range from 3--9, with higher scores 
indicating greater loneliness.   

**Time points:** The ULS was administered as part of the Primary Questionnaires 
at all 4 time points (T1, T2, T3, T4).    

**Differences between the CCC implementation and the original scale:** The 3-item 
loneliness scale was administered with slight modification to the instructions 
and the first item. The original questionnaire does not specify a time frame; 
in the CCC study participants were asked to respond with respect to the last month.  

*CCC Instructions*: “The next questions are about feelings you might have had. 
For each item, indicate how often you felt that way <u>over the past month</u>.”    

*Original Instructions*: “The next questions are about how you feel about different 
aspects of your life. For each one,tell me how often you feel that way.”  

The original scale was designed to be read to participants. So the first item 
began with the word “First”—this was removed from the written version administered 
here.  


**Additional information:**  

NOTE: The original 20-item scale has been revised twice (Russell, Peplau, & 
Cutrona, 1980; Russel, 1996) since its original publication to improve issues 
of response bias.
