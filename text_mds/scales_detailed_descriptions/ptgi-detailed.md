## Post-traumatic growth: Posttraumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI)  

### Overview of the scale    

**Description:** The 21-item Posttraumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI) is 
designed to measure positive outcomes reported by persons who have 
experienced traumatic events (Tedeschi & Calhoun, 1996). The scale includes 
five subscales: (1) New Possibilities, (2) Relating to Others, (3) Personal 
Strength, (4) Spiritual Change, and (5) Appreciation of Life.   

**Example items:** *“I have a greater appreciation for the value of my own life”*
(Appreciation of Life) and *“I am more likely to try to change things which need changing”*
(New Possibilities).   

**Response scale:** Participants were asked to indicate the degree to which 
they experienced particular changes <u>as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic</u> on 
a 6-point Likert scale (0--5: 0 = I did not experience this change as a result 
of the pandemic, 1 = I experienced this change to a very small degree as a 
result of the pandemic, 2 = I experienced this change to a small degree as 
a result of the pandemic, 3 = I experienced this change to a moderate degrees 
as a result of the pandemic, 4 = I experienced this to a great degree as a 
result of the pandemic, 5 = experienced this change to a very great degree 
as a result of the pandemic).  

**Scoring:** No items are reverse scored. Items are summed to calculate a total 
posttraumatic growth score. Five subscales may be calculated by summing the 
items as follows:  
 

-   Relating to Others, items 6, 8, 9, 15, 16, 20, 21    
-   New Possibilities, items 3, 7, 11, 14, 17  
-   Personal Strength, items 4, 10, 12, 19   
-   Spiritual Change, items, 5, 18  
-   Appreciation of Life, items 1, 2, 13  

**Interpretation:** Possible total scores range from 0--105, with higher scores 
indicating greater posttraumatic growth. Five subscales may also be calculated, 
with the ranges below. Higher scores indicating greater growth in each domain.  

- Relating to others (0--35)  
- New possibilities (0--25)  
- Personal strength (0--20)  
- Spiritual change (0--10)  
- Appreciation of life (0--15)  


**Time points:** The PTGI was administered as part of the Primary Questionnaires 
at all 4 time points (T1, T2, T3, T4).    

**Differences between the CCC implementation and the original scale:** 
<u>Changes to instructions:</u> The Posttraumatic Growth Inventory was given in 
its original form, with the exception that that response options ended with 
“as a result of the pandemic” rather than “as a result of my crisis”.
