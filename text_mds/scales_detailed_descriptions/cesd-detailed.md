## Depression: The Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression (CES-D)  

### Overview of the scale   

**Description:** The 20-item Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression 
(CES-D) scale is designed to measure symptoms associated with depression, and 
includes questions relating to sleep quality, appetite, and feelings of 
loneliness among others (Radloff, 1977). 

**Example items:** *“I felt that I was just as good as other people”*,
*“I thought my life had been a failure”* and 
*“I felt that everything I did was an effort.”*   

**Response scale:** Participants were asked to indicate the frequency with 
which they felt each item <u>over the past month</u> on a 4-point Likert scale (0–3: 
0 = rarely or none of the time (less than 1 day each week); 1 = some or a little 
of the time (1–2 days each week); 2 = occasionally or a moderate amount of the 
time (3–4 days each week); 3 = most or all of the time (5–7 days each week)).  


**Scoring:** Items 4, 8, 12, and 16 are reverse scored. Items are then summed to calculate a total depression score. There are no subscales.  

**Interpretation:** Possible scores range from 0–60, with higher scores 
indicating greater depressive symptoms. Scores over 16 identify individuals at 
risk for clinical depression (Lewinsohn, Seeley, Roberts, & Allen, 1997). 
Although the CES–D is commonly used to measure depressive symptomology in 
research participants, it cannot be stated that an individual has Major 
Depressive Disorder based on the results of the scale.  

*NOTE*: The original CES–D was determined to include four separate factors or 
subscales: depressive affect, positive affect, somatic symptoms, and 
interpersonal, but subsequent research suggests a variety factor structures with some studies finding 3 factors (Carleton et al., 2013), some finding 5 (Thorson & Powell, 1993) and others sources suggesting there are 8 subscales <a href="https://www.brandeis.edu/roybal/docs/CESD-R_Website_PDF.pdf" target="_blank">(https://www.brandeis.edu/roybal/docs/CESD-R_Website_PDF.pdf)</a>. Here we use only the total score.   


**Time points:** The CES-D was administered as part of the Primary
Questionnaire at all 4 assessment time points (T1, T2, T3, T4).  

**Differences between the CCC implementation and the original scale:**
The original CES–D was administered with minor modification to the instructions 
and the items.  

<u>Changes to instructions:</u> The original scale asks respondents about the last week, in the CCC Study, participants were asked to think about the last month.  

CCC Instructions: “Below is a list of ways you might have felt or behaved. 
Please indicate how often you have felt this way during the past month”.  

Original Instructions: “Below is a list of ways you might have felt or behaved. 
Please tell me how often you have felt this way during the past week”.  

To reflect this change in timescale, the words “each week” were added to Likert 
scale descriptions (e.g., “rarely or none of the time (less than 1 day)” became 
“rarely or none of the time (less than 1 day each week)”.  

<u>Changes to items:</u> An additional open-ended question was added to the end of the scale at all study time points to allow participants to share additional information related to their responses (“If you would like to describe the events or circumstances that contributed to the experiences you’ve endorsed above, you can provide more detail here:”). Responding to this prompt was optional.  


**Additional information:**  

- An attention check item was included in this scale between items 15 and 16.   
- There are various iterations of the CES–D (e.g., CES–D revised, CES–D-8, and 
CES–D-17).
