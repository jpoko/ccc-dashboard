## Life satisfaction (LSQ)    

### Overview of the scale   

**Description:** Life satisfaction was measured with 5 questions measuring 
satisfaction in different domains of life: 1) life in general, 2) life at home, 
3) present job or career, 4) physical health, 5) spiritual, religious or 
meditation practices.    


**Example items:** *“Overall, how satisfied are you with life in general these days?”*, and 
*“In general, how satisfied are you with your spiritual, religious, or meditation practices?”*   


**Response scale:** Participants were asked to indicate their level of agreement 
with each item using a 5-point Likert-type scale (1–5: 1 = not at all satisfied, 
2 = not very satisfied, 3 = neutral, 4 = satisfied, 5 = very satisfied).    


**Scoring:** Items are averaged to create a life satisfaction score that ranges 
from 1--5. No items are reversed scored and there are no subscales.  




**Interpretation:** Possible Life Satisfaction total scores range from 1--5. 
Higher scores indicate greater life satisfaction.   




**Time points:** The Life Satisfaction Questionnaire was administered at all 
four assessment points. (T1, T2, T3, T4)    

**Differences between the CCC implementation and the original scale:**  

<u>Changes to items:</u> An additional open ended question was added at the end 
of the scale at each time point it was administered to allow participants to 
share any additional context about their life satisfaction (“Is there any 
additional context you would like to share about the topics listed above?”). 
Responding to this question was optional.
