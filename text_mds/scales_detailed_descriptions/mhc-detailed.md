## Flourishing: The Mental Health Continuum-short form (MHC-SF)  

### Overview of the scale    

**Description:** The 14-item Mental Health Continuum-short form (MHC-SF; 
Lamers et al. (2011)) is designed to measure 3 facets of well-being: emotional, 
psychological, and social). The MHC-SF consists of 3 items for emotional 
well-being, 5 items for social well-being, and 6 items for psychological 
well-being. These items were selected from the 40-item long form (MHC-LF) to 
represent the most prototypical items for each of the 3 facets. The long form 
consists of 7 items measuring emotional well-being, 15 items (or five 3-item 
subscales) measuring the five dimensions of Keyes’ model of social well-being 
(1998), and 18 items (or six 3-item subscales) measuring the six dimensions of 
Ryff’s model of psychological well-being (1989).  

**Example items:** *"During the past month, how often do you feel satisfied with life?"*
(emotional), *"During the past month, how often do you feel that you had something important to contribute to society?"*
(social), and *"During the past month, how often do you feel that you had experiences that challenged you to grow and become a better person?"* (psychological).   

**Response scale:** Participants were asked to indicate how frequently they had 
experienced each symptom of well-being <u>over the past month</u> using a 6-point 
Likert scale (0--5: 0 = never, 1 = once or twice, 2 = about once a week, 
3 = 2 to 3 times a week, 4 = almost every day, 5 = every day).  


**Scoring:** No items are reverse scored. Items are summed to calculate a total 
well-being score. Subscale scores are calculated by summing the items as follows:  

- Emotional well-being, items 1--3  
- Social well-being, items 4--8  
- Psychological well-being, items 9--14  


Alternatively, respondents' scores can be categorized as flourishing, moderate 
mental health, or languishing according to the following rubric:  

- ***Flourishing*** requires a response of "almost every day" or "every day" to 
1 or more of the 3 emotional well-being (hedonic) questions, and to 6 or more 
of the 11 positive functioning (eudaimonic) questions (the social and 
psychological subscales combined).  
- ***Languishing*** requires a response of "once or twice" or "never" to 1 or 
more of the 3 emotional (hedonic) well-being questions, and to 6 or more of the 
11 positive functioning questions (the social and psychological subscales combined).  
- ***Moderate*** mental health refers to those who are neither flourishing nor 
languishing.  


**Interpretation:** Possible total scores range from 0--70, with higher scores 
indicating greater well-being. Subscale scores range from 0--15 for emotional 
well-being, 0--25 for social well-being and 0--30 for psychological well-being. 
Flourishing, languishing, and moderate mental health are interpreted as described 
above.  

**Time points:** The MHC-SF was administered as part of the Primary Questionnaires 
at all 4 time points (T1, T2, T3, T4).    

**Differences between the CCC implementation and the original scale:** We used 
a version of the scale obtained from Barbra Fredrickson’s research group. 
Several slight wording differences between the original scale and the version 
used in the CCC study are listed below:  

- item #3: original wording: “satisfied with life”; adapted wording “satisfied”  
- item #4: original wording: “that you had something <u>important</u> to contribute 
to society”; adapted wording: “that you had something to contribute to society”  
- item #5: original wording: “that you belonged to a <u>community (like a social group, or your neighborhood)</u>”; adapted wording: “that you belonged to a <u>community/social group</u>”  
- item #6: original wording: “that our society is <u>a good place or</u> becoming 
a better place for <u>all</u> people”; adapted wording: “that our society is becoming a 
better place for people”  
- item #12: original wording: that you <u>had</u> experiences that <u>challenged</u> 
you to grow and become a better person”; adapted wording: “that you <u>have</u> 
experiences that <u>challenge</u> you to grow and become a better person?”  

  

**Additional information:**  

- An attention check item was included between items 9 and 10.
