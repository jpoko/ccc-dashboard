## Anxiety: State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Trait (STAI)    

### Overview of the scale  

**Description:** The 40-item State-Trait Anxiety Inventory is designed to 
measure the presence, severity, and likelihood of trait and state anxiety 
(Spielberger, Gorsuch, Lushene, Vagg, & Jacobs, 1983). The 20-items relating to 
trait anxiety were administered in this study.  

**Example items:** *"I feel nervous and restless"*, 
*"I worry too much over something that really doesn’t matter"* and *“I feel secure.”*      

**Response scale:** Participants were asked to indicate the frequency with which 
they felt each item generally <u>during the past month</u> using a 4-point Likert 
scale (1--4: 1 = almost never; 2 = sometimes; 3 = often; 4 = almost always).

**Scoring:** Items 1, 3, 6, 7, 10, 13, 14, 16, and 19 are reverse scored 
(T-Anxiety: 21, 23, 26, 27, 30, 33, 34, 36, 39 from the original full version). 
Items are then summed to calculate a total trait anxiety score. There are no
subscales.   

**Interpretation:** Possible scores range from 20--80, with higher scores 
indicating greater anxiety.   

Scores are interpreted as below:  

  -   20--37 = low/no anxiety   
  
  -   38--44 = moderate anxiety   
  
  -   45--80 = high anxiety   
  


**Time points:** The STAI-T was administered as part of the Primary
Questionnaires at all 4 time points (T1, T2, T3, T4).   


**Differences between original and CCC implementation:** Item numbering for the 
adapted version (#1--20) corresponds to item numbering (#21--40) on the original
—reflecting the fact that only the ‘trait’ portion of the STAI was given. 

Wording change in instructions: The original wording asks participants to 
indicate how they generally feel without imposing a time frame to differentiate
‘trait’ from ‘state’ (how they feel in the present moment). The adapted wording 
imposes a time frame “indicate how you’ve generally felt during the past month.” 
This change was made to make the STAI more consistent with the other questionnaires
given in this section, and with the administration of the questionnaires in the 
Spirit Rock 2 study.

*CCC Instructions*: “Below are a number of statements that people may use to 
describe themselves. Read each statement and indicate how you’ve generally felt 
during the past month.”  

*Original Instructions*: “A number of statements which people have used to 
describe themselves are given on the following pages. Read each statement 
and then select the appropriate button to indicate how you generally feel.”
