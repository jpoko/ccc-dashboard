## Social connectedness: The Social Connectedness subscale of the MHSIP Adult Consumer Satisfaction Survey (SC)   

### Overview of the scale   

**Description:** The 4-item Social Connectedness subscale of the Mental Health 
Statistics Improvement Program (MHSIP) Adult Consumer Satisfaction Survey 
(Shafer and Ang, 2018) is designed to measure the extent to which an individual 
is socially connected, and has “natural supports” in place—family, friends, 
and acquaintances. More information about the MSHIP can be found in the User’s 
Guide for Participant Satisfaction Surveys <a href="https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/publications/p0/p00887.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.  


**Example items:** *“I am happy with the friendships I have”* 
and *“In a crisis, I would have the support I need from family or friends”.*   

**Response scale:** Participants were asked to indicate their level of 
agreement with each item on a 5-point Likert scale (1–5: 1= strongly agree; 
2 = agree; 3 = mixed/neutral; 4 = disagree; 5 = strongly disagree).   


**Scoring:** No items are reverse scored. Items are summed to calculate a 
total social connectedness score. There are no subscales.  

**Interpretation:** Possible scores range from 4--20, with lower
scores indicating greater social connectedness.   

**Time points:** The social connectedness subscale of the MHSIP adult 
satisfaction survey was given as part of the Primary Questionnaire at the 
baseline and 1-year assessments (T1, T4). It was intended to be given at all 
timepoints, but was inadvertently left out of the 4- and 8-month questionnaires.  


**Differences between the CCC implementation and the original scale:** The 
Social Connectedness subscale is designed to be given as part of the MHSIP 
Satisfaction Surveys. Here we administered only the self-report version of the 
subscale. 

We included these generic instructions before the items: “Please indicate how 
much you agree or disagree with each of the following statements:”
