## Discrimination: Major Experiences of Discrimination (MDISC)    

### Overview of the scale   

**Description:** The 6-item Major Experiences of Discrimination inventory, 
derived from the original 9-item Major Experiences of Discrimination inventory 
(NSAL and SASH version), is used to measure acute life discrimination (abbreviated 
version; Sternthal, Slopen, & Williams, 2011). Items are designed to measure unfair 
treatment in domains such as employment, education, housing, and interactions 
with the police. For each item, follow-up questions ask 1) how many times the 
respondent has experienced a particular event 2) how long ago the most recent 
of those experiences occurred, and 2) to what cause the respondent attributes 
the unfair treatment (e.g., to gender, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality or 
immigration status).   



**Example items:** *“For unfair reasons, have you ever not been hired for a job?”* 
and 
*"Have you ever been unfairly prevented from moving into a neighborhood because the landlord or a realtor refused to sell or rent you a house or apartment?"*.         


**Response scale:** Participants were asked to indicate:  

1. whether the event had ever happened, responding yes or no using a radio button    
2. how many times it had happened, with the option to enter a number into a text field    
3. how long ago each experience had happened, using a dropdown with the options: 
(1) in the past week, (2) in the past month, (3) in the past year, (4) more than a year ago  
4. to what cause the respondent attributes the unfair treatment, using a checkbox
to select as many options that applied: (1) Your ancestry or national origins; 
(2) Your gender; (3) Your race; (4) Your age; (5) Your religion; (6) A physical 
disability; (7) Your height; (8) Your height; (9) Your sexual orientation; (10) 
Your education or income level; (11) Some other aspect of your physical appearance; 
(12) Something else  






**Scoring:** “Yes” responses for each of the six possible experiences of 
discrimination are summed to make a score ranging from 0-6. The frequency of 
these discriminatory experiences are also summed for each experience for a total 
frequency score. Scores can also be calculated for each cause the respondent 
attributes the unfair treatment to (e.g., to gender, ethnicity, age, religion, 
nationality or immigration status).    


**Interpretation:**    



**Time points:** The Major Experiences of Discrimination inventory was administered 
at the baseline and 1-year assessments (T1, T4).  



**Differences between the CCC implementation and the original scale:**  

<u>Changes to instructions:</u> In the 1-year assessment, participants were 
asked to report the experiences they had had since the baseline assessment.
