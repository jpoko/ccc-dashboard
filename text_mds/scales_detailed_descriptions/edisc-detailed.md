## Everyday discrimination: The Everyday Discrimination Scale  

### Overview of the scale

**Description:** The 10-item Everyday Discrimination Scale is used to assess 
exposure to chronic life discrimination. Each question presents a discriminatory 
event that can occur in day-to-day life. For each question, follow up questions 
ask for what reason the respondents attribute these experiences (e.g., to gender, 
ethnicity, age, weight, religion). When using the frequency-based scoring method, 
possible scores range from 10 to 60. When using the chronicity-based scoring 
method, possible scores range from 0 to 2600. Higher scores indicate greater 
exposure to chronic discrimination throughout life.  


**Example items:** *"People act as if they are afraid of you"*, 
*"You are called names or insulted"*, and 
*"People act as if they think you are not smart."*  

**Response scale:** Participants indicate how often any of the listed things 
happen to them in their day-to-day life on a 6-point scale (1 = Never, 2 = Less 
than once a year, 3= A few times a year, 4 = A few times a month, 5 = At least 
once a week, 6 = Almost everyday). Follow-up questions ask for what reason the 
respondents attribute these experiences (e.g., to gender, ethnicity, age, 
weight, religion).  


**Scoring:** The Everyday Discrimination Scale consists of 10 items, each rated 
on a 6-point scale from 'never' to ‘almost every day’. There are two scoring 
methods for this scale:  

1.  Frequency-based scoring: Each response is given a value according to the 
Likert scale (‘never’=1 to ‘almost everyday’=6). To calculate the total score, 
responses to all 10 items are summed to produce a score ranging from 10 to 60.  
2.  Chronicity-based scoring: Each response is given a value that reflects the 
estimated total number of discriminatory events experienced per year (‘never’=0, 
‘less than once a year’=0.5, ‘a few times a year’=3, ‘a few times a month’=36, 
‘at least once a week’=104, and ‘almost everyday’=260). To calculate the total 
score, responses to all 10 items are summed to produce a score ranging from 0 to 2600.    

Subscale scores can also be calculated by grouping items based on the reason 
for discrimination, such as gender, ethnicity, age, weight, or religion. We did 
not calculate scores grouped by reason for discrimination because we implemented 
this part of the scale inconsistently (sometimes only allowing one reason to be
selected, other times allowing multiple reasons to be selected).  



**Interpretation:** Higher scores indicate greater exposure to chronic 
discrimination throughout life.  


**Time points:** The Everyday Discrimination Scale was administered at the 
baseline and 1-year assessments (T1, T4).
