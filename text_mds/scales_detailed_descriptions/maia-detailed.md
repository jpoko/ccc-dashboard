## Interoception: Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness  

### Overview of the scale

**Description:** The 32-item Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive 
Awareness (MAIA) is used to assess one’s conscious level of interoception—defined 
as the process by which the nervous system senses, interprets, and integrates 
signals originating from within the body (Mehling et al., 2012). The MAIA 
contains 8 subscales:

-   Attention regulation: the ability to sustain and control attention to body 
sensations  
-   Body listening: tendency to actively listen to the body for insight   
-   Emotional awareness: ability to attribute specific physical sensations to 
physiological manifestations of emotions  
-   Noticing: awareness of uncomfortable, comfortable, and neutral body 
sensations  
-   Not-distracting: the tendency not to use distraction to cope with 
uncomfortable sensations  
-   Not-worrying: the tendency not to experience emotional distress with 
physical discomfort  
-   Self-regulation: ability to regulate distress by attention to body sensations  
-   Trusting: assessing the experience of one’s body as safe and trustworthy   





**Example items:** *"When I am tense, I notice where the tension is located in my body"*
(noticing), and 
*"When I am in conversation with someone, I can pay attention to my posture"*
(attention regulation).  

**Response scale:** Participants were asked to indicate how often each statement 
applied to them using a 5-point Likert-type scale (0–4: 0 = never, 1 = rarely, 
2 = sometimes, 3 = often, 4 = always).   


**Scoring:** Items 5–9 are reversed scored. Subscales are then calculated by 
averaging the following sets of items:  

-   Noticing, items 1–4
-   Not-distracting, items 5–7
-   Not-worrying, items 8–10
-   Attention regulation, items 11–17
-   Emotional awareness, items 18–22
-   Self-regulation, items 23–26
-   Body listening, items 27–29
-   Trusting, items 30–32



**Interpretation:** Scores for the 8 subscales range from 0–4, with higher 
scores indicating greater interoception in each domain.  



**Time points:** The Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness was 
administered at the baseline and 1-year assessments (T1, T4).   

**Differences between the CCC implementation and the original scale:**

<u>Changes to response options</u>: The original Likert-scale was a 6 point 
Likert scale from 0-5 with Never (0) and always (5) being the two anchors. 
In the CCC adapted version, a 5 point Likert scale 0-4 was given with Never 
(0) and always (4) being the two anchors.  

In the original scale, labels were only given for the two anchors of Never (0) 
and always (5). In the CCC adapted version, labels were included for each point 
along the Likert scale.  

<u>Changes to items</u>: An additional open ended question was added to the 
end of the scale at both timepoints it was administered to allow participants 
to share additional thoughts (“Is there anything else you’d like to share about 
your awareness of your internal body sensations—Or about how these may have 
changed in the past few months?”). Responding to this question was optional.
