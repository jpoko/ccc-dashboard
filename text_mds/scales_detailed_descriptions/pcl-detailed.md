## Post-traumatic stress: PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5)  

### Overview of the scale   

**Description:** TThe 20-item PTSD Checklist (PCL-5) is designed to measure the 
20 symptoms of PTSD described in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of 
Mental Disorders (DSM-5; Blevins, Weathers, Davis, Witte, & Domino, 2015). 
It is often used to screen individuals for, monitor symptoms of, and make 
provisional diagnoses of PTSD. There are three versions of the PTSD checklist, 
each of which is tailored to a particular population (i.e., military personnel, 
civilians, or specific subgroups). The scale can also be given in 3 different 
formats: 1) with specific reference to a particular traumatic event (Criterion 
A); 2) without reference to a particular event (without Criterion A); or with 
an extended Criterion A assessment and the revised Life Events Checklist for 
DSM-5 (LEC-5). In the CCC study, we used the civilian version without criterion 
A. Various versions of the scale can be found <a href="https://www.ptsd.va.gov/professional/assessment/adult-sr/ptsd-checklist.asp" target="_blank">here</a>.  

**Example items:** *“Repeated, disturbing, and unwanted memories of the stressful experience?”* 
and *“Trouble remembering important parts of the stressful experience?”*  

**Response scale:** Participants were asked to indicate the degree to which 
they are bothered by each item <u>over the last month</u> on a 5-point Likert scale 
(0--4: 0 = not at all; 1 = a little bit; 2 = moderately; 3 = quite a bit; 
4 = extremely).  


**Scoring:** The PCL-5 can be scored in different ways:  

Items can be summed to calculate a total symptom severity score ranging from 
0--80. No items are reverse scored, and no subscales are generated. 
*This is the method used in the CCC study.* 

Alternatively, DSM-5 symptom cluster severity scores can be obtained by summing
the scores for the items within a given cluster: Cluster B: re-experiencing 
(items 1--5), Cluster C: avoidance (items 6--7), Cluster D: negative cognitions 
and mood (items 8--14), and Cluster E: arousal (items 15--20).  


**Interpretation:** For diagnostic purposes, the PCL-5 should be interpreted 
by a clinician.  

For our research purposes we have calculated a total score ranging from 0--80, 
with higher scores indicating greater PTSD symptom severity. According to the 
<a href="https://www.ptsd.va.gov/professional/assessment/documents/using-PCL5.pdf" target="_blank">PCL-5 documentation</a>, initial research suggests that a PCL-5 cutoff score between 
31--33 is indicative of probable PTSD across samples (though additional 
research is needed). In general, use of a cutoff score tends to produce more 
reliable results than the DSM-5 diagnostic rule. However, because the population 
and the purpose of the screening may warrant different cutoff scores, users are 
encouraged to consider both of these factors when choosing a cutoff score.  

Alternatively, a provisional PTSD diagnosis could be made by treating each 
item rated as 2 = "Moderately" or higher as a symptom endorsed, then following 
the DSM-5 diagnostic rule which requires at least: 1 B item (questions 1--5), 
1 C item (questions 6--7), 2 D items (questions 8--14), 2 E items 
(questions 15--20).  

In a treatment setting, if a patient were to meet a provisional diagnosis using 
either of the methods above, they would require further assessment 
(e.g., CAPS-5) to confirm a diagnosis of PTSD. There are currently no 
empirically derived severity ranges for the PCL-5.  

<u>Interpreting changes in the PCL-5:</u> Evidence for the PCL for DSM-IV 
suggests that a 5-10 point change represents reliable change (i.e., change not 
due to chance) and a 10-20 point change represents clinically significant change. 
Therefore, it is recommended that a 5-point change be used as a minimum 
threshold for determining whether an individual has responded to treatment and 
a 10-point change as a minimum threshold for determining whether the 
improvement is clinically meaningful using the PCL for DSM-IV.  

*It is important to note that in the CCC study, the PCL was not administered in relation to a particular traumatic event, but rather as a checklist of potential PTSD symptoms without a specific referent, and thus the interpretation of longitudinal changes will differ from its more standard use.*  


**Time points:** The PCL-5 was administered as part of the Primary Questionnaires 
at all 4 timepoints (T1, T2, T3, T4).   

**Differences between the CCC implementation and the original scale:**
The civilian version of the PCL-5 was given without criterion A. The instructions 
were modified slightly as follows:   

*CCC Instructions:* “These questions are about problems and complaints that 
people sometimes have in response to stressful life experiences. Please indicate 
how much you have been bothered by each problem in the past month. (Note that 
the stressful events you are responding to may have happened prior to the past 
month.)”    

*Original Instructions:* “Below is a list of problems that people sometimes 
have in response to a very stressful experience. Please read each problem 
carefully and then circle one of the numbers to the right to indicate how much 
you have been bothered by that problem in the past month.”    

**Additional information:**  

- The current self-report rating scale for the PCL-5 is based on the DSM-V 
and ranges from 0--4 for each symptom, which differs from prior versions based 
on the DSM-IV that used a rating scale of 1--5. Rating scale descriptors are 
the same: "Not at all," "A little bit," Moderately," "Quite a bit," and 
"Extremely." The change in the rating scale, combined with the increase from 
17 to 20 items means that PCL-5 scores are not compatible with PCL for DSM-IV 
scores and cannot be used interchangeably.
