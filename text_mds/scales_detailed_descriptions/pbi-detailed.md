## Parental bonding: Parental Bonding Instrument (PBI)    

### Overview of the scale   

**Description:** The 25-item Parental Bonding Instrument is used to retrospectively 
assess parental styles by asking adults (over the age of 16) to respond to items 
about how they remember their parents during their first 16 years (Parker, 
Tupling, & Brown, 1979). The Parental Bonding Instrument scale contains two 
subscales: 1) care/warmth and 2) control/overprotection. Participants answer 
questions about how they remember their caregivers for each caregiver separately.   



**Example items:** *“Spoke to me in a warm and friendly voice,”*, 
*"Liked me to make my own decisions,"*
and  
*“Made me feel I wasn’t wanted.”*   


**Response scale:** At baseline, participants were asked to indicate the degree 
to which each item reflects their memory of their parents on a 4-point 
Likert-type scale (0--3: 0 = Very Unlike, 1 = Moderately Unlike, 2 = Moderately 
Like, 3 = Very Like).   


**Scoring:** Items 2, 3, 4, 7, 14, 15, 16, 18, 21, 22, 24, and 25 are reverse 
scored. Subscales are calculated by summing the following items:  

-   Care items: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 11, 12, 14, 16, 17, 18, 24   
-   Overprotection items: 3, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 15, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25  




**Interpretation:** Possible total scores range from 0--75. Scores 
for the care subscale range from 0--36 and scores for the overprotection subscale 
range from 0--39. Higher scores indicate higher levels of parental bonding.   

In addition to generating care and protection scores for each scale, parents 
can be assigned to one of four quadrants:  

-   affectionate constraint = high care and high protection  
-   affectionless control = high protection and low care  
-   optimal parenting = high care and low protection  
-   neglectful parenting = low care and low protection  

Cut-off scores for high or low category assignments are as follows: For mothers, 
a care score of 27.0 and a protection score of 13.5. For fathers, a care score 
of 24.0 and a protection score of 12.5.  




**Time points:** The Parental Bonding Instrument was administered at baseline (T1). 


**Differences between the CCC implementation and the original scale:**  

Parental Bonding Instrument was given in its original form with the following 
exceptions:   


<u>Wording change:</u> The Likert scale items on the original scale are presented 
in reverse order; so, ‘very like’ is presented on the left side instead of ‘very unlike’.
