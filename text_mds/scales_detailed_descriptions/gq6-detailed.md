## Gratitude: Gratitude Questionnaire-Six Item Form (GQ-6)    

### Overview of the scale   

**Description:** The 6-item Gratitude Questionnaire-Six (GQ-6) is a shortened 
version of the original 44-item Gratitude Questionnaire (GQ) developed by 
McCullough, Emmons, and Tsang (2002). The GQ-6 is designed to measure gratitude 
intensity, or how often individuals feel grateful in their daily lives.   


**Example items:** *“I have so much in life to be thankful for”*, and 
*“As I get older, I find myself more able to appreciate the people, events, and situations that have been part of my life history.”*   


**Response scale:** Participants were asked to indicate their level of agreement 
with each item using a 7-point Likert-type scale (1–7: 1 = strongly disagree, 
2 = moderately disagree, 3 = slightly disagree, 4 = neutral/mixed, 5 = slightly 
agree, 6 = moderately agree, 7 = strongly agree).    


**Scoring:** Items 3 and 6 are reverse scored. Items are then summed to create 
a total score. There are no subscales.   




**Interpretation:** Possible Gratitude Questionnaire-Six Item GQ-6 scores range 
from 6–42. Higher scores indicate a greater level of gratitude.  



**Time points:** The Gratitude Questionnaire-Six Item Form was administered at 
all four assessment points (T1, T2, T3, T4).  

**Differences between the CCC implementation and the original scale:**  

<u>Response option change(s):</u> The original scale response options were: 
2 = disagree, 4 = neutral, and 6 = agree. In the CCC study, response options 
were: 1 = Strongly Disagree 2 = Moderately Disagree 3 = Slightly Disagree 
4 = Neutral/Mixed 5 = Slightly Agree 6 = Moderately Agree, and 7 = Strongly Agree.
