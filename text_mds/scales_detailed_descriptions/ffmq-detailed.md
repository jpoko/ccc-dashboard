## Mindfulness: Five-Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ)  




### Overview of the scale

**Description:** The 15-item Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (Baer, Smith, 
Hopkins, Krietemeyer, & Toney, 2006) is based on the 39-item Five Facet 
Mindfulness Questionnaire, which is designed to measure five aspects of mindfulness. 
The FFMQ contains five subscales, of which two were used: 1) non-reactivity to 
inner experience (7 items) and 2) describing (labeling feelings/thoughts with words, 
8 items).   




**Example items:** *"I watch my feelings without getting lost in them"*
(non-reactivity), and 
*"I’m good at finding words to describe my feelings"*
(describing).  

**Response scale:** Participants were asked to indicate the likelihood of each 
item for them generally on a 5-point Likert-type scale (1–5: 1 = never or 
rarely true, 2 = rarely true, 3 = sometimes true, 4 = often true, 5 = very 
often or always true).   




**Scoring:** Items were numbered according to the original FFMQ item numbering 
and were presented in sequential ascending order (e.g., 2, 4, 7). Items 12, 16, 
and 22 are reverse scored. Items for each subscale are then averaged to calculate 
subscale totals.  


-   Nonreactivity: items 4, 9, 19, 21, 24, 29, 33  
-   Describing: items 2, 7, 12R, 16R, 22R, 27, 32, 37  





**Interpretation:** Possible subscale scores range from 1–5, with higher scores 
indicating lower reactivity to inner experiences or a higher capacity to 
describe thoughts and feelings, respectively.  





**Time points:** The Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire subscales were 
administered at the baseline and 1-year assessments (T1, T4).    

**Differences between the CCC implementation and the original scale:**

<u>Numbering of items</u>: The CCC adapted version only includes items from
two subscales: Describe (D) and Non-reactivity (NR). The items were presented 
in the same order they were presented in the original scale.   


**Additional Information:**

An attention check item (att.5) was included as the 5th item in this scale.
