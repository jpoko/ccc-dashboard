## Stress coping:  Brief-COPE  



### Overview of the scale

**Description:** The 28-item Brief-COPE is designed to measure a broad range of 
coping responses to a stressful event, including how individuals confront, react 
to, and feel about the event (Carver, 1997). The Brief-COPE is an abridged version 
of the original 60-item COPE (Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced) Inventory 
(Carver, Scheier, & Weintraub, 1989) and covers 14 different coping strategies,
with each of these subscales being composed of two items. Those strategies are: 
(1) Self-distraction, (2) Active Coping (3) Denial, (4) Substance Use, (5) Use 
of Emotional Support, (6) Use of Instrumental Support, (7) Behavioral Disengagement, 
(8) Venting, (9) Positive Reframing, (10) Planning, (11) Humor, (12) Acceptance, 
(13) Religion, and (14) Self-blame.   




**Example items:** *"I’ve been turning to work or other activities to take my mind off things"*
(self-distraction), and 
*"I’ve been getting comfort and understanding from someone"* 
(emotional support).  

**Response scale:** Participants completed the Brief-COPE in the Primary 
Questionnaires as a measure of their dispositional coping style over the last 
week, and in the Weekly Inventories in response to a particular stressor they 
had experienced in that week. Data here is from the Primary Questionnaires.  

In the Primary Questionnaires, participants were asked to indicate the extent 
to which they used each strategy over the past week the using a 4-point Likert 
scale (1–4: 1 = I haven’t been doing this; 2 = I’ve been doing this a little, 
3 = I’ve been doing this some, 4 = I’ve been doing this a lot).   

In the Weekly Inventories participants were asked to indicate the extent to 
which they used each strategy with respect to the stressor that they had 
described in a prior journaling prompt, using a similar, but modified 4-point 
Likert scale (1–4: 1 = I didn’t do this at all; 2 = I did this a little bit, 
3 = I did this a medium amount, 4 = I did this a lot).   


**Scoring:** No items are reverse scored, and no total score is calculated. 
14 subscales are calculated by summing items as follows:  

-   Self-distraction, items 1 and 19
-   Active coping, items 2 and 7
-   Denial, items 3 and 8
-   Substance use, items 4 and 11
-   Use of emotional support, items 5 and 15
-   Use of instrumental support, items 10 and 23
-   Behavioral disengagement, items 6 and 16
-   Venting, items 9 and 21
-   Positive reframing, items 12 and 17
-   Planning, items 14 and 25
-   Humor, items 18 and 28
-   Acceptance, items 20 and 24
-   Religion, items 22 and 27
-   Self-blame, items 13 and 26


**Interpretation:** Possible scores for each coping strategy range from 2–8. 
Higher scores indicate greater use of a particular strategy.   



**Time points:** The Brief-COPE was administered at all timepoints (T1, T2, T3, T4), 
both in the main questionnaire (Primary) to report general coping over the past 
week (n = 4), and in the Weekly Inventories in response to specific reported 
stressors (n = 7).  


**Differences between the CCC implementation and the original scale:**

<u>Order of items</u>: Items were administered in the same order as the original 
28-item Brief-COPE reported in Carver (1997).


<u>Changes to items</u>: A minor wording change was made for item 9: original
“I’ve been saying things to let my unpleasant feelings escape”; CCC adapted 
“I’ve been saying things to express my unpleasant feelings.”  


An additional open-response item (#29) was also added to allow participants to 
describe other coping strategies they might have used.  


At the 8-month and 1-year timepoints, an open-ended prompt was included at the 
end of the scale that gave participants the chance to describe or clarify any of 
the options they had selected above (“If you would like to describe or clarify 
the any of the options you selected above, you can provide more detail here:”). 
Responding to this prompt was optional.  


<u>Changes to response options</u>: Response options for the dispositional scale 
(given in the Primary Questionnaires) were reworded slightly, but retained the 
original meaning:  

1.   “I haven’t been doing this at all” was changed to “I haven’t been doing this”.
2.   “I’ve been doing this a little bit” was changed to “I’ve been doing this a little”.
3.   “I’ve been doing this a medium amount” was changed to “I’ve been doing this some”.
4.   “I’ve been doing this a lot” was not changed.  

Response options for the stressor-specific scale (given in the Weekly Inventory) 
were reworded to read “I did x” rather than “I’ve been doing x”.  


NOTE: Carver (1997) explicitly states that individuals are free to use all 
items of the scale or choose items from selected subscales, and that items 
can be given in any order. The language can also be adapted to reflect the time 
scale that is of interest. Further, the instructions can be adapted as needed 
for an individual’s particular application. “The flexibility of application of 
the items is determined by the needs and imagination of the researcher who is
using them.”
