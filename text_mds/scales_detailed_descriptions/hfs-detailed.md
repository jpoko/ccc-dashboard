## Forgiveness: Heartland Forgiveness Scale (HFS)    

### Overview of the scale   

**Description:** The 18-item Heartland Forgiveness Scale (HFS) is designed to 
measure individual levels of forgiveness towards oneself, others, and situations. 
The HFS is a self-report measure consisting of 18 items comprising three 
subscales: 1) forgiveness towards self, 2) forgiveness towards others, and 3) forgiveness 
towards situations.   




**Example items:** *“I hold grudges against myself for negative things I’ve done”* 
(forgiveness toward self subscale),
*"I continue to be hard on others who have hurt me"* 
(forgiveness toward others subscale),
and 
*"I eventually make peace with bad situations in my life"* 
(forgiveness toward situations subscale).           


**Response scale:**  Participants were asked to rate these items on a 7-point 
Likert scale (1–7: 1 = Almost always false of me, 3 = More often false of me, 
5 = More often true of me, 7 = Almost always true of me).   



**Scoring:**  Items 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, and 17 are reversed scored. 
Items are summed to calculate a total forgiveness score. The following items are 
summed to calculate the subscale scores:  

-   Self: items 1–6   
-   Others: items 7–12  
-   Situations: items 13–18  


**Interpretation:** Possible total scores range from 18–126. Scores on the three 
subscales range from 6–42. Higher scores indicate higher levels of forgiveness.   


Total scores: One’s score on the Total HFS indicates how forgiving a person 
tends to be of oneself, other people, and uncontrollable situations.   

-   A score of 18 to 54 on the Total HFS indicates that one is usually unforgiving.  
-   A score of 55 to 89 on the Total HFS indicates that one is about as likely to 
forgive, as one is not to forgive oneself, others, and uncontrollable situations.  
-   A score of 90 to 126 on the Total HFS indicates that one is usually forgiving.  


Subscale scores: One’s score on the three HFS subscales indicate how forgiving 
a person tends to be of oneself (Forgiveness of Self), other people (Forgiveness 
of Others), or situations beyond anyone’s control (Forgiveness of Situations).   


-   A subscale score of 6 to 18 indicates that one is usually unforgiving of oneself, 
other people, or uncontrollable situations, respectively.  
-   A subscale score of 19 to 29 indicates that one is about as likely to forgive 
as to not forgive oneself, other people, or uncontrollable situations, respectively.  
-   A subscale score of 30 to 42 indicates that one is usually forgiving of 
oneself, other people, or uncontrollable situations, respectively.  




**Time points:** The Heartland Forgiveness scale was administered once at the 
1-year assessment (T4).
