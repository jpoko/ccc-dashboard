**Description:** Perceived stress was measured with the 10-question 
Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), which is designed to measure how individuals 
judge stressful situations in their life (Cohen et al., 1983). These questions 
are designed to assess how unpredictable, uncontrollable, and overwhelming 
people find their lives (Cohen & Williamson 1988). Possible scores range from 
0--40, with higher scores indicating higher stress levels. Scores of 0--13 
indicate low perceived stress, scores of 14--26 indicate moderate perceived 
stress, and scores of 27--40 indicate high perceived stress.
