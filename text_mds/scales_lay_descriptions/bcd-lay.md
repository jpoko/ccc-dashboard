**Description:** Stress coping was measured with the 28-question Brief-COPE, which is designed to measure a broad range of coping responses to a stressful event, including how individuals confront, react to, and feel about the event (Carver, 1997). This questionnaire includes 14 different coping strategies, each of which is asked about in two different ways. Those strategies are: (1) Self-distraction, (2) Active Coping (3) Denial, (4) Substance Use, (5) Use of Emotional Support, (6) Use of Instrumental Support, (7) Behavioral Disengagement, (8) Venting, (9) Positive Reframing, (10) Planning, (11) Humor, (12) Acceptance, (13) Religion, and (14) Self-blame. Possible scores for each coping strategy range from 2â€“8, with higher scores indicating greater use of that particular strategy.
