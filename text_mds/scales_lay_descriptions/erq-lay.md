**Description:** The Reappraisal Capability-Emotion Regulation 
Questionnaire (ERQ) includes 11 questions designed to measure a personâ€™s 
tendency to regulate their emotions through cognitive reappraisal (changing the 
way you think of a situation to help calm an emotional reaction). The original 
questionnaire consists of questions about Cognitive Reappraisal and Expressive 
Suppression, but in this study, we only asked about Cognitive Reappraisal. An 
additional 5 Cognitive Reappraisal questions were developed for our scale as 
well. Possible scores range from 11-77 with higher scores indicating higher 
cognitive reappraisal.
