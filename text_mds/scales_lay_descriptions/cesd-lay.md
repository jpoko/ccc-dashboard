**Description:** Depression symptoms were measured with the Center for 
Epidemiology Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale, which consists of 20 questions 
designed to measure the symptoms associated with depression, including sleep 
quality, appetite, and feelings of loneliness among others (Radloff, 1977). 
Possible scores range from 0--60, with higher scores indicating greater depressive 
symptoms. Scores over 16 identify individuals at risk for clinical depression.
