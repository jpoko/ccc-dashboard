**Description:** Interoception was measured with the Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness (MAIA), which includes 32 questions designed to measure interoception (Mehling et al., 2012). This questionnaire includes 8 subscales:   

-   Attention regulation: the ability to sustain and control attention to body sensations 
-   Body listening: tendency to actively listen to the body for insight 
-   Emotional awareness: ability to attribute specific physical sensations to physiological manifestations of emotions  
-   Not-distracting: the tendency not to use distraction to cope with uncomfortable sensations  
-   Not-worrying: the tendency not to experience emotional distress with physical discomfort
-   Noticing: awareness of uncomfortable, comfortable, and neutral body sensations  
-   Self-regulation: ability to regulate distress by attention to body sensations  
-   Trusting: assessing the experience of one’s body as safe and trustworthy  


Scores for each subscale range from 0–4, with higher scores indicating greater interoception.
