**Description:** Self-compassion was measured with the 12-item 
Self-Compassion Scale Short Form (SCS-SF). This questionnaire contains six 
subscales: self-kindness, self-judgment, common humanity, isolation, mindfulness, 
and over-identification. Items are averaged to make a total mean score. Total 
mean scores range from 1-5, with higher scores indicating greater self-compassion.
