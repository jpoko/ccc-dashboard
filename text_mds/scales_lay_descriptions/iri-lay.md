**Description:** Empathic Concern and Personal Distress were measured using two subscales of the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI; Davis, 1980, 1983). The IRI was designed to measure dispositional empathy and typically consists of four subscales: Perspective Taking, Fantasy, Empathic Concern, and Personal Distress. Empathic Concern and Personal Distress subscale scores range from 0â€“28. Higher scores indicate higher levels of empathic concern and personal distress.
