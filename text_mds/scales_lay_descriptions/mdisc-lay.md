**Description:** Life discrimination was measured with the Major 
Experiences of Discrimination inventory, which includes 6 questions to measure 
unfair treatment in domains such as employment, education, housing, and interactions 
with the police (abbreviated version; Sternthal, Slopen, & Williams, 2011). For each 
question, follow-up questions asked: 1) how many times the respondent experienced 
a particular event 2) how long ago the most recent of those experiences occurred, 
and 2) to what cause the respondent attributed the unfair treatment (e.g., to 
gender, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality or immigration status). The Major
Experiences of Discrimination inventory consists of a total number of experiences
selected by the respondent and the sum of the frequency of these discrimination
experiences.
