**Description:** Care/warmth and control/overprotection were measured with 
the Parental Bonding Instrument (PBI), which includes 25 questions designed to 
assess parental styles (Parker, Tupling, & Brown, 1979). The Parental Bonding
Instrument scale contains two subscales: 1) care/warmth and 2) control/overprotection. Participants responded to statements 
about how they remembered their caregiver(s) on a 4-point scale ranging from 
‘very unlike’ to ‘very like.’ Possible total scores range from 0–75, with care/warmth subscores ranging from 0–36 and control/overprotection subscores ranging from 0–39. Higher scores indicate higher levels of parental bonding.
