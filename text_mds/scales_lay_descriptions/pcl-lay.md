**Description:** PTSD symptomatology was measured with the 20-question 
PTSD Checklist (PCL-5), which is designed to measure the 20 symptoms of PTSD 
described in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5; 
Blevins, Weathers, Davis, Witte, & Domino, 2015). It is often used to screen 
individuals for, monitor symptoms of, and make provisional diagnoses of PTSD. 
In the CCC Study, we administered the civilian PTSD checklist, without reference 
to a particular traumatic event. Higher scores indicate greater PTSD symptom 
severity.
