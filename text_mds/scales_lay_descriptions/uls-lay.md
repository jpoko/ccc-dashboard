**Description:** Loneliness was measured using the UCLA Loneliness Scale, 
which consists of 3 questions designed to measure an individualâ€™s feelings of 
loneliness (Hughes, Waite, Hawkley, & Cacioppo, 2004). Possible total scores 
range from 3--9, with higher scores indicating greater loneliness.
