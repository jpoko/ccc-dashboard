**Description:** Anxiety was measured with the 20-question trait portion 
of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, which is designed to measures the 
presence, severity, and likelihood of trait anxiety (Spielberger, Gorsuch, 
Lushene, Vagg, & Jacobs, 1983). Possible trait-anxiety scores range from 1--80, 
with higher scores indicating greater anxiety. Scores of 20--37 indicate low/no
anxiety, scores of 38--44 indicate moderate anxiety, and scores of 45--80
indicate high anxiety.
