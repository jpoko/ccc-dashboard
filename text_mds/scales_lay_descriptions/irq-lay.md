**Description:** The tendency to use others as a means to regulate
one's own emotions (interpersonal regulation) was measured with the 16-item
Interpersonal Regulation Questionnaire (Williams, Morelli, & Zaki, 2018). 
The scale measures the *tendency* to use and the *perceived efficacy* of 
interpersonal emotional regulation to *decrease negative* and *increase positive*
emotions. Total scores range from 16--112, with higher
scores indicating higher levels of interpersonal emotion regulation. Four
subscale total scores can also be calculated, ranging from 4--28, with higher 
scores indicating higher levels of interpersonal emotion regulation for each domain:
Negative-Tendency, Negative-Efficacy, Positive-Tendency, Positive-Efficacy.
