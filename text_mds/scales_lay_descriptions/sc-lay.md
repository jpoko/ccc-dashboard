**Description:** Social connection was measured using the Social 
Connectedness aspect of the Mental Health Statistics Improvement Program 
(MHSIP) Adult Consumer Satisfaction Survey (Shafer and Ang, 2018), which 
consists of 4 questions designed to measure an individual’s social connectedness. 
The presence of “natural supports” such as family, friends, and acquaintances 
are some factors that gauge social connectedness. Possible scores range from 
4--20, with lower scores indicating greater social connectedness.
