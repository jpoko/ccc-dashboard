**Description:** Rumination and reflection were measured using the Rumination-Reflection Questionnaire (RRQ), which includes 24 questions designed to measure self-attentiveness. The RRQ consists of two subscales: rumination and reflection. In this study, we asked questions about reflection at the baseline and 1-year follow-up assessments. We only asked questions about rumination at the 1-year follow-up assessment. Possible scores for each subscale range from 12â€“60. Higher scores indicate higher levels of rumination or reflection.
