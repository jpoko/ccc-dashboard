**Description:** Flourishing well-being was measured with the 14-question 
Mental Health Continuum “short form” (MHC-SF), which is a shorter version of the 
Mental Health Continuum questionnaire designed to measure 3 aspects of well-being: 
emotional, social, and psychological (Lamers et al., 2011). The MHC-SF consists 
of 3 questions about emotional well-being, 5 questions about social well-being, 
and 6 questions about psychological well-being. Total scores range from 0--70, 
with higher scores indicating greater well-being. Three subscales may also be 
calculated, with higher scores indicating greater well-being in each domain: 
emotional well-being (0--15), social well-being (0--25), and psychological 
well-being (0--30).
