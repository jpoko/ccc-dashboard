**Description:** Different aspects of mindfulness were measured with the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ), which includes 15 questions to measure five facets of mindfulness. The FFMQ contains five subscales, of which two subscales were used: 1) describing (labeling feelings/thoughts with words, 8 items), and 2) non-reactivity to inner experience (7 items). Possible subscale scores range from 8–40 for describing and 7–35 for nonreactivity. Higher scores indicate a higher capacity to describe thoughts and feelings or or lower reactivity.
