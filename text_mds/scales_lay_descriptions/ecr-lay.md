**Description:** Attachment was measured with a modified version of the Experiences in Close Relationships-12 questionnaire (ECR-12), which includes 12 questions designed to measure adult romantic attachment (Lafontaine et al., 2015). This questionnaire contains two subscales: attachment anxiety and avoidant attachment. Subscale scores range from 1â€“7. Higher scores indicate greater attachment insecurity.
