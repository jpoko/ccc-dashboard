**Description:** Childhood trauma was measured with a modified version 
of the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-Short Form (CTQ-SF), which includes 28 
questions designed to measure childhood trauma and maltreatment 
(Bernstein et al., 2003). The CTQ-SF contains five subscales: 1) emotional abuse, 
2) physical abuse, 3) sexual abuse, 4) emotional neglect, and 5) physical neglect. 
Possible Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-Short Form total scores range from 24-125, 
and subscale scores range from 5â€“25. Higher scores indicate higher levels of 
maltreatment.
