### Data processing

The number of possible ethnicity combinations that people selected
ranged from 48 (participants who started the study) to 70 (all
applicants). Some of these combinations only had 1 individual who
provided that particular combination. From these combinations, we then
aggregated peoples responses into categories approximating the US Census
categories which are:

\- The US Census Categories are:

 - \*\*White.\*\* A person having origins in any of the original

peoples of Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa. It includes

people who indicate their race as "White" or report responses

such as German, Irish, English, Italian, Lebanese, and Egyptian.

The category also includes groups such as Polish, French,

Iranian, Slavic, Cajun, Chaldean, etc.

 - \*\*Black or African American.\*\* A person having origins in any of

the Black racial groups of Africa. It includes people who

indicate their race as "Black or African American," or report

responses such as African American, Jamaican, Haitian, Nigerian,

Ethiopian, or Somali. The category also includes groups such as

Ghanaian, South African, Barbadian, Kenyan, Liberian, Bahamian,

etc.

 - \*\*American Indian and Alaska Native.\*\* A person having origins

in any of the original peoples of North and South America

(including Central America) and who maintains tribal affiliation

or community attachment. This category includes people who

indicate their race as "American Indian or Alaska Native" or

report entries such as Navajo Nation, Blackfeet Tribe, Mayan,

Aztec, Native Village of Barrow Inupiat Traditional Government,

or Nome Eskimo Community.

 - \*\*Asian.\*\* A person having origins in any of the original

peoples of the Far East, Southeast Asia, or the Indian

subcontinent including, for example, India, China, the

Philippine Islands, Japan, Korea, or Vietnam. It includes people

who indicate their race as "Asian Indian," "Chinese,"

"Filipino," "Korean," "Japanese," "Vietnamese," and "Other

Asian" or provide other detailed Asian responses such as

Pakistani, Cambodian, Hmong, Thai, Bengali, Mien, etc.

 - \*\*Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander.\*\* A person having

origins in any of the original peoples of Hawaii, Guam, Samoa,

or other Pacific Islands. It includes people who indicate their

race as "Native Hawaiian," "Chamorro," "Samoan," and "Other

Pacific Islander" or provide other detailed Pacific Islander

responses such as Palauan, Tahitian, Chuukese, Pohnpeian,

Saipanese, Yapese, etc.

 - \*\*Two or more races.\*\* People may choose to provide two or more

races either by checking two or more race response check boxes,

by providing multiple responses, or by some combination of check

boxes and other responses. The race response categories shown on

the questionnaire are collapsed into the five minimum race

groups identified by OMB, and the Census Bureau's "Some Other

Race" category. For data product purposes, "Two or More Races"

refers to combinations of two or more of the following race

categories: White, Black or African American, American Indian or

Alaska Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander,

or Some Other Race.

There are two reasons that we reduced the number of categories.

Privacy: In several cases there were only 1 or 2 people who endorsed a
particular category, so we combined smaller categories into a larger
group to protect people's identities and privacy.

Statistical purposes: For most statistical analyses, it is important to
have groups of similar sizes, and reducing the number of categories made
that more likely.

We decided on 9 ethnicity categories:

-   Asian

-   Black, African American, or Afro-Caribbean

-   Hispanic or Latino

-   Indigenous, Pacific Islander, or Multi-ethnic

     - White

     - Prefer not to say

Each response was placed into one of these 9 categories.

***Rules for categorization:***

Detailed explanation forthcoming.

Please see the sankey diagram ('Categorization' tab above) to see
exactly how the responses were categorized into our 9 ethnicity
categories.
