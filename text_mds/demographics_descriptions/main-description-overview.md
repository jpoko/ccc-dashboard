Select a demographic category to learn more about how these data was collected 
from participants and how we are using it in our study. Some variables are being
used exactly as they were collected (e.g., income, education). Some variables 
have been categorized in some way, such as gender - participants could select
multiple options and we categorized the responses into 4 groups. 

You will see a detailed description about what was collected from participants
and any data processing steps that we conducted for each demographic variable.
For variables in which we did group the responses, there will be an additional 
tab that has a visualization illustrating how the responses were categorized.
