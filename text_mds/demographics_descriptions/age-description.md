## Age  

### Data collected     

When individuals applied to participate in the study, they were asked to provide
their current age as a whole number.   

**Question prompt:** How old are you? (in years)  


### Data processing  

For binned age information, participants' ages were placed into ~10-year bins. 
The youngest possible age for applicants was 18 years old, so individuals
between 18 and 20 were put into the youngest age bin (18--30 years old) instead
of having a small bin that encompassed only 2 years (18--20 years old). The
oldest participant was 88 years old, but there were few participants older than
70 years old, so any participants older than 70 years old were placed in the 
oldest age bin (71--88 years old). The age bin categories are in the following
section.  

### Final categories   

- 18--30 years old  
- 31--40 years old  
- 41--50 years old  
- 51--60 years old  
- 61--70 years old  
- 71--88 years old
