## Location  

### Data collected     

When individuals applied to participate in the study, they were asked to provide
their address. Zip code information was pulled from the address they provided.     

   


### Data processing  

Zip code information collected from participants was matched to a database of 
latitude and longitude pairs of the centroid of the zip code using the R package
zipcodeR, version 0.3.5. (G.C. Rozzi, zipcodeR: Advancing the analysis of spatial data
  at the ZIP code level in R, Softw. Impacts. (2021) 100099)  


### Final data  

Data plotted on the map is the centroid of the zip code provided by participants. It is
NOT the actual location of any participant.
