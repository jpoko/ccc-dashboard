## Gender  

### Data collected     

When individuals applied to participate in the study, they were asked to provide
their gender by selecting from a list of options. They were able to select all
that applied as well provide their own description.  

**Question prompt:** How would you describe your gender? (choose all that apply)  

**Response options (check box, select all that apply):**    

- Man  
- Woman  
- Transgender  
- Non-binary  
- Gender queer  
- Agender  
- Gender fluid  
- Questioning/unsure  
- Prefer to self-describe (fill in response)  
- Prefer not to say  



### Data processing  

The number of possible gender combinations that people selected ranged from 18
(participants who started the study) to 35 (all applicants). Some of these 
combinations only had 1 individual who provided that particular combination. From 
these combinations, we reduced the number of possible categories. 

There are two reasons that we reduced the number of categories.  

Privacy: In several cases there were only 1 or 2 people who endorsed a particular 
category, so we combined smaller categories into a larger group to protect people's 
identities and privacy.  
 
Statistical purposes: For most statistical analyses, it is important to have groups of 
similar sizes, and reducing the number of categories made that more likely.  

We decided on 4 gender categories:   

- woman  
- man  
- gender expansive  
- prefer not to say  


Each response was placed into one of these 4 categories.   

***Rules for categorization:***    

- If only 'man' was selected - categorized as 'man'    
- If only 'prefer not to say' was selected - categorized as 'prefer not to say'  
- If only 'woman' was selected - categorized as 'woman'  
- If 'woman' and 'prefer not to say' were selected - categorized as 'woman'      
- All other responses were categorized as 'gender expansive'   

Please see the sankey diagram ('Categorization' tab above) to see exactly how 
the responses were categorized into our 4 gender categories.    

### Final categories
