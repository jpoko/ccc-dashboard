**Description:** At each assessment,
participants were asked "How long have you been practicing per session/sit 
(on average)?" with two inputs ('hours' and 'minutes') where they could 
fill in their response. This information was converted to a 'total minutes per 
sit' value, reflecting how long, on average, they meditated per sit/session. 

Details:  

1) generally for 'hours' entries between 3 and 10 (hours > 3 and hours < 10), response was made NA (unclear if responses were hours or minutes)   
2) generally for 'hours' entries of 10 and above (hours >= 10) that did not have a 'minutes' entry, response was considered as minutes   
3) if 'hours' entry was 1 and 'minutes' entry was 60, response was considered 60 minutes (interpreted as duplicate information)  
4) specific removals (response was made NA): 300 minutes; 1.5 hours and 75 minutes; 1920 hours; 720 minutes   
5) 'hours' was then converted to minutes (hours * 60 = hour minutes)    
6) hour minutes was added to 'minutes' for total minutes per sit
