**Description:** To determine how many minutes per week
participants practiced on average, we used information from two questions (how
many days per week participants were practicing and how many minutes per sit
participants were practicing), and used that information to calculate
how many minutes per week on average participants were practicing.  

Question 1: "How many days per week have you been practicing formal meditation
(on average)?" with radio button options for 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and Less than once per week. Less than once per week was scored as 0.5 days.   

Question 2: "How long have you been practicing per session/sit 
(on average)?" with two inputs ('hours' and 'minutes') where they could 
fill in their response. This was converted to a 'total minutes per sit' value. See 'minutes/sit' description for specific details on how this value was calculated.    

Number of days per week they practiced was multiplied by total minutes per sit
to get minutes per week practicing.
