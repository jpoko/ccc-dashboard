# Exploring relationships between meditation practice and well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic

## About the study:

The <a href="https://contemplative-coping-covid-19.org/" title="Will open in a new window" target="_blank">Contemplative Coping during COVID-19 (CCC)</a> is a multidisciplinary research study designed to learn about the lived experiences of meditation practitioners in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The primary goals of the study are to understand:

1.  the types of pandemic-related stressors individuals experienced,
2.  whether participants drew on contemplative practices, like meditation, to cope with these stressors,
3.  if engagement with contemplative practice promoted better biological and psychological outcomes, as indexed by blood cell telomere length and self-report measures of stress, mental health, and well being.

### Data collection and recruitment  

The CCC study was a year-long longitudinal study with data collected at 4 time points. Questionnaire data were collected every 4-months and blood samples were collected for telomere measurements at the baseline and 1-year follow-up assessments.  

-   People enrolled in the study on a rolling basis between June and December of 2020, and data collection took place between June of 2020 and February of 2022.  
-   Participants were recruited via web-based announcements (emails, social media posts, etc.) by meditation teachers, meditation centers, and meditation research groups from across the US.  
-   People interested in participating in the study were required to fill out an application form that included demographic questions to ensure that they met the minimum inclusion criteria: 1) being over 18; 2) residing in the US; and 3) having some prior experience with meditation. Demographic questions were also used to admit the most diverse study cohort possible from the applicant pool.  

A total of 819 eligible applicants applied, 608 were admitted into the study, 389 people participated in the baseline assessment, and 236 participated in the 1-year follow-up.

## How to use this dashboard:

This dashboard currently includes options to explore 1) participant demographics, 2) individual self-report measures of various constructs related to mental health and well-being of participants, 3) correlations between measures of mental health and well-being, and 4) relationships between measures of well-being and both lifetime and ongoing measures of meditation experience at each of the study time points.

-   Main navigation is along the top, and then within each section there may be additional subsections, indicated by tabs below the main navigation bar.
-   The dashboard is dynamic, so you will be able to select the variables you want to investigate and apply different options for how to plot those data.
