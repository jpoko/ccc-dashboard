Alluvial diagrams showing the flow of participants across data collection time points based on their PSS level (low, moderate, or high) at each time point. The width of the flow bands and the height of the boxes are scaled according to the number of people in each PSS level. The vertical boxes/bars are essentially stacked bar charts showing the proportion of individuals who have low, moderate, and high PSS levels at each time point. The bands flowing between time points show changes between PSS levels from one time point to the next, and correspond to the number of people in that category, such as the number of people with a High PSS level at Time 1 who then had a Moderate PSS level at Time 2.
