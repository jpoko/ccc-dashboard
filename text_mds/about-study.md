# Exploring relationships between meditation practice and well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic

## About the study  

The <a href="https://contemplative-coping-covid-19.org/" title="Will open in a new window" target="_blank">Contemplative Coping during COVID-19 (CCC)</a> is a multidisciplinary research study designed to learn about the lived experiences of meditation practitioners in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Primary aim  
To understand if and how people used meditation and other contemplative practices to cope with stressors during the COVID-19 pandemic, and whether this practice was related to better mental and physical health outcomes.   

The pandemic's disparate impacts on communities cannot be ignored. Thus, our research also aims to understand how these inequities may have influenced the consequences of the pandemic and the role of contemplative practices for different communities as they navigated the unfolding circumstances of the pandemic.  

### How  
We assessed changes in life stressors, coping mechanisms, psychological well-being, and telomere length—a biological marker of cellular aging—over a one year period. Additionally, we measured prior life challenges and adversities to better understand the participants' experiences within the context of their lives.  


## Recruitment  

Participants were recruited via web-based announcements (emails, social media posts, etc.) by meditation teachers, meditation centers, and meditation research groups from across the US.   

Interested individuals completed a screening form to determine their eligibility and provide demographic information to maximize the diversity of the study cohort.  

### Eligibility  
Participants had to be 18 years or older, currently residing in the United States, and have some previous meditation experience.  

Meditators were included if they currently or previously had a semi-regular or regular home practice, practiced using a meditation app, had taken a meditation class or course, attended a meditation retreat, or practiced meditation in another format.  



### Data collection and recruitment  

The CCC study was a year-long longitudinal study with data collected at 4 time points. Questionnaire data were collected every 4-months and blood samples were collected for telomere measurements at the baseline and 1-year follow-up assessments.  

-   People enrolled in the study on a rolling basis between June and December of 2020, and data collection took place between June of 2020 and February of 2022.  
-   Participants were recruited via web-based announcements (emails, social media posts, etc.) by meditation teachers, meditation centers, and meditation research groups from across the US.  
-   People interested in participating in the study were required to fill out an application form that included demographic questions to ensure that they met the minimum inclusion criteria: 1) being over 18; 2) residing in the US; and 3) having some prior experience with meditation. Demographic questions were also used to admit the most diverse study cohort possible from the applicant pool.  

A total of 819 eligible applicants applied, 608 were admitted into the study, 389 people participated in the baseline assessment, and 236 participated in the 1-year follow-up.

## How to use this dashboard:

This dashboard currently includes options to explore 1) participant demographics, 2) individual self-report measures of various constructs related to mental health and well-being of participants, 3) correlations between measures of mental health and well-being, and 4) relationships between measures of well-being and both lifetime and ongoing measures of meditation experience at each of the study time points.

-   Main navigation is along the top, and then within each section there may be additional subsections, indicated by tabs below the main navigation bar.
-   The dashboard is dynamic, so you will be able to select the variables you want to investigate and apply different options for how to plot those data.
