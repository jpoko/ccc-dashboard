### Correlation matrix ordering  

Select the type of ordering for the variables in the correlation matrix. In some
cases, you may want to reorder the matrix to show variables that are more or less
associated with one another.  

Options:  

-   Default - selected scale variables first, followed by adversity variables, and then meditation variables  
-   Alphabetical  
-   First principal component order  
-   Hierarchical clustering order, using complete agglomeration method
