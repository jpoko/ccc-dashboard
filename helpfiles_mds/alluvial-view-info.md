### Alluvial view info  

The flow of levels over time is presented two ways:   

-	**Participant tracked** - Participants tracked over time across all 4 time points. The color of the flow is based on the participantsâ€™ baseline level at T1. For instance, those that had a 'low' level at T1 will be blue in color across all time points, even if they had a high level at T2 and a moderate level at T4.  
-	**Proportion of change** - Change in proportion of PSS levels from time point to time point. The color of the flow between each time point reflects the level from the one time point to the next time point. All flows from a level will have the color of that level (i.e., all flows leaving the Moderate level box will be colored pink). For instance, if an individual has a low level at T1, a high  level at T2, and a moderate level at T3, they will be included in a blue flow from the Low box at T1 that flows to the High box at T2, and then included in a yellow flow from High box at T2 that flows to the Moderate box at T3. As such, it is not possible to track an individual over time and only reflects the proportion of levels at each time and the proportion of each level that changes or stays the same from time point to time point.
