### Correlation matrix info

Only significant correlations are presented - if a square is missing (aside 
from the diagonal), it is because there is not a significant correlation between
the two variables given the significance level selected. 

The value shown in the square is the correlation coefficient value for any
significant correlations.   

You can select:  

-   the variables to include in the correlation matrix  
-   the significance level to use as the cutoff to show correlations  
-   the order in which the variables appear in the matrix  



#### Type of correlation:  
Pearson correlation
