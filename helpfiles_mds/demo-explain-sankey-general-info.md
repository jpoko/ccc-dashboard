### Sankey diagram

The sankey diagrams showing the original responses from the participants (on 
the left) and the categories that we have used (on the right). You can see how
each participant response was categorized by following the line. The size of
the box and the width of the line reflects the number of cases.  

The diagram is interactive - you can get more information by hovering over
