### Participant recruitment stages  

You can select the recruitment stage to see participant responses from different
stages of the recruitment process.   

The stages are funneled, from those who applied, to those who actually started
in the study.    

General process: people applied to participate, they needed to pass our initial
screening, they were then admitted into the study, they then needed to provide
consent to participate in the study, and lastly, they started in the study.    


- **applied** - all people who applied to participate in the study
- **screened** - people who passed our initial screening  
- **admitted** - people who were admitted into the study
- **consented** - people who provided consent to participate  
- **started** - people who started at the baseline data collection time point
